This set of classes is a lucene implementation of the SPUD retrieval 
model that appears in "A Polya Urn Document Language Model for 
Improved Information Retrieval" by Ronan Cummins, Jiaul Hoque Paik, 
and Yuanhua Lv.



The classes depend on the following publicly available jar files:

lucene-core-5.0.0.jar
lucene-queryparser-5.0.0.jar
lucene-analyzers-common-5.0.0.jar
lucene-queries-5.0.0.jar
commons-math3-3.3.jar
jsoup-1.7.3.jar



The only two classes with main methods are:
indexing.LuceneTRECIndexer
scoring.QuerySearch
